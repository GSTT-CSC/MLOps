## MLFlow Requirements

The requirements_mlflow.txt file controls the version of MLFlow that is used to track training runs and store models. This is the UI that you can interact with.

Whereas in requirements.txt in the root of this repository, that just sets the version of MLFlow used in that "mlops run" instance.

It is important that these match to ensure that there are no versioning issues.
